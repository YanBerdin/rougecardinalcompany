# [TASK023] - Partners Management

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16

## Original Request

Provide CRUD for partners with logos and display order so marketing can manage partner lists.

## Thought Process

Partners need logo uploads and a display-order field. Reuse Media Library for logos and provide drag-and-drop sorting in the admin UI.

## Implementation Plan

- Confirm `partners` table schema (logo url, name, url, display_order): `supabase/schemas/README.md` `supabase/migrations/migrations.md`.
- DAL methods for persistence and ordering.
- Admin UI with list, upload control, and drag-to-reorder.
- Persist ordering in DB and revalidate homepage/partners fragment on changes.
