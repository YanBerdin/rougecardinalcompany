# [TASK029] - Media Library

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16

## Original Request

Implement a central media library to upload, organize, tag and manage all media files.

## Thought Process

Media handling must be robust: upload, thumbnails, metadata, tagging, and deletion/replace. Use Supabase Storage with server-side processing for thumbnails.

## Implementation Plan

- Create admin Media Library UI with folder/tag filters.
- DAL for listing and metadata storage; store metadata in `media` table.
- Implement server-side thumbnail generation (Edge function or background job).
- Ensure permissions and soft-delete support.

## Progress Log
