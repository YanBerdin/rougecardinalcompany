# [TASK034] - Performance Optimization

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16

## Original Request

Optimize performance: remove artificial delays, optimize queries, and implement caching strategy prior to launch.

## Thought Process

Focus on slow DB queries, unnecessary client bundles, and cache hotspots. Use profiling to guide work and prioritize high-impact fixes.

## Implementation Plan

- Run profiling on key pages and DB queries.
- Add DB indexes and optimize SQL queries in DAL.
- Implement caching layers (edge-cache, revalidate tags) where appropriate.
- Reduce client bundle sizes and lazy-load non-essential components.

## Progress Log
