-- Storage Buckets Configuration
-- Ordre: 02c - Buckets requis avant les tables qui référencent storage_path

/*
 * Bucket: medias
 * ===================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Central storage for all media assets (team photos, press images, etc.)
 *   Referenced by multiple tables via storage_path column.
 * 
 * SECURITY:
 *   - Public read access (public = true)
 *   - Authenticated users can upload
 *   - Only admins can delete
 * 
 * TABLES USING THIS BUCKET:
 *   - medias (storage_path column)
 *   - membres_equipe (via photo_media_id FK)
 *   - communiques_presse (via header_media_id FK)
 *   - Future: spectacles, articles_presse, etc.
